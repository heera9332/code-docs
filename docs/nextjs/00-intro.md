## Features of NextJS

NextJS has many great features for building a full stack web application.

- **SSR** - SSR stands for Server Side Rendering, mean's your page completely build on server, and then serve to client as html page with page content, not something like react, react send empty html file to client (browser) and JavaScript enject (insert) the html content in page. that the ReactJS of not good for SEO.
- **SEO** - NextJS supports SSR, its great for SEO.
- **Static Site Generation** - if we are not using any server functionality in web page then its good time to generate your wep to static we app. in the plain html/css/js. and we does dot require to run NodeJS on server. static pages serve like normal html page but it nextjs generated static pages has functionality of react and site generation like normal. when we use html/css/js, it good, but it takes, so if we use nextjs, but we doest not require anything other html pages, the we create Static.

## NextJS vs ReactJS

## App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js has two different routers: the App Router and the Pages Router.

> The App Router is a newer router that allows you to use React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming. The Pages Router is the original Next.js router, which allowed you to build server-rendered React applications and continues to be supported for older Next.js applications.
