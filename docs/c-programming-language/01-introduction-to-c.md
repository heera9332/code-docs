# Introduction to C Programming

C is a powerful, general‑purpose programming language that has played a significant role in the development of modern software. Known for its efficiency and performance, C is widely used for system‑level programming, such as developing operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems.

## A Brief History

- Developed by [**Dennis Ritchie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) in the **early 1970s** at Bell Labs  
- Created as an improvement over the B programming language  
- Introduced structured programming concepts and became the foundation for many modern languages like [C++](https://isocpp.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), and [Python](http://python.org/)  

## Major Version Updates

- **C89/C90 (ANSI C)**  
  - Standardized by ANSI in 1989 and by ISO in 1990  
  - Introduced function prototypes, `void` type, and the standard library  
- **C99**  
  - Published in 1999  
  - Added new data types (`long long`, `_Bool`), inline functions, variable‑length arrays, and improved library support  
- **C11**  
  - Published in 2011  
  - Introduced `_Static_assert`, anonymous structures/unions, improved Unicode support, and a basic threads API (`<threads.h>`)  
- **C17**  
  - Published in 2017  
  - A bug‑fix and clarifications revision over C11, with no major new features  
- **C23**  
  - Latest revision published in 2023  
  - Adds features like UTF‑8 string literals, `[[attribute]]` syntax, improved memory safety functions, and more flexible `static` assertions  

## Key Characteristics

- **Structured & Procedural**: Promotes organized, modular code  
- **File Extensions**: `.c` for source files, `.h` for headers  
- **Performance‑Oriented**: Compiled directly into machine code for maximum speed  

## Features of C Language

- **System‑Level Access** – Low‑level memory manipulation and hardware control  
- **Fast Execution** – Compiled to native code for high speed  
- **High Performance** – Ideal for resource‑constrained and performance‑critical applications  
- **Rich Library Support** – Standard libraries plus room for custom implementations  
- **User Friendly** – Clean syntax and logical structure  
- **Portable** – Can be compiled on various platforms with minimal changes  

## Applications of C Language

- **Operating Systems** – Core of [UNIX/Linux](/docs/linux/) and many [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows) components  
- **Compilers** – Many language compilers are implemented in C  
- **Database Systems** – Engines like [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) use C for core functionality  
- **Device Drivers** – Direct hardware interaction code  
- **Embedded Systems** – Microcontroller programming for appliances, vehicles, etc.  
- **Internet of Things (IoT)** – Powering low‑level functions in smart devices  

## Summary

C is more than just a programming language—it’s the foundation of modern computing. Its combination of performance, portability, and low‑level access makes it an essential tool for developers, especially those working in system programming or embedded development.
