# OODB (Object-Oriented Database)

## Object-Oriented Databases â€“ Introduction

ðŸ”¸ What is an Object-Oriented Database?
An Object-Oriented Database (OODB) is a database that integrates object-oriented programming principles (like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) with database capabilities.

Stores objects instead of rows and columns.

Objects = data + behavior (methods).

Closely aligned with OOP languages like Java, C++, Python.

## Concept of Object-Oriented Database

- OODB directly stores and retrieves complex objects, which include both:

  - State (data)
  - Behavior (methods/functions)

### Key Features:

| Feature         | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation   | Data + methods stored together                    |
| Inheritance     | Object types can inherit from other types         |
| Object Identity | Each object has a unique OID (like a primary key) |
| Persistence     | Objects persist beyond program execution          |
| Complex Objects | Supports nested, multilevel object structures     |
