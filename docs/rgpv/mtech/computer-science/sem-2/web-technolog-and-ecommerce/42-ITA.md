# ITA (Information Technology Act), Cyber crime, Security

In a world where digital transactions, online identities, and cloud services are part of daily life, cyber security and digital law have become critically important. India, one of the fastest-growing digital economies, faces increasing threats from cybercrime — and has responded with legislative and technological measures.

## The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000

The Information Technology Act, 2000 is India’s primary law to address digital communication, electronic commerce, and cybercrime. It gives legal recognition to electronic transactions, digital signatures, and electronic evidence, making it the cornerstone of India’s cyber law framework.

### Objectives of the IT Act:

- Provide legal validity to electronic documents and signatures
- Define offenses related to cybercrime and prescribe penalties
- Protect data and online privacy
- Facilitate e-governance and digital business

### Key Features:

- **Digital Signature Recognition:** Legally validates e-signatures using public-key encryption.
- **E-Governance:** Allows electronic filing of forms, records, and applications.
**Cyber Offenses:** Covers hacking, identity theft, phishing, pornography, cyberstalking, and more.
- **Cyber Adjudication:** Establishes Cyber Appellate Tribunal for dispute resolution.
- **Jurisdiction:** Applies even to offenses committed outside India, if the system affected is within India.

### Notable Sections:

| Section | Description                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
