# DES (Data Encryption Standards)

DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are both symmetric-key encryption algorithms — meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

- Introduced: 1977 by IBM, adopted by the U.S. government.
- Key size: 56 bits
- Block size: 64 bits
- Rounds: 16 rounds of Feistel cipher
- Type: Symmetric-key block cipher

## ❌ Why DES is Obsolete:

- 56-bit key is too short today → easily brute-forced.
- Can be cracked within hours or less using modern computers.

> DES is now considered insecure and deprecated by most modern systems.
