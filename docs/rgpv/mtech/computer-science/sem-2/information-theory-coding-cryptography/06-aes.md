# AES â€“ Advanced Encryption Standard

- Introduced: 2001 as a replacement for DES
- Based on: Rijndael algorithm (pronounced "Rhine-dahl")
- Key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits
- Block size: 128 bits

## Rounds:

- 10 rounds for 128-bit key
- 12 rounds for 192-bit
- 14 rounds for 256-bit

## Why AES is Strong and Widely Used:

- Used in: HTTPS, VPNs, file encryption, government data
- Efficient on both software and hardware
- Resistant to all known practical attacks
