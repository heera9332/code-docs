# SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm

The Secure Hash Algorithms are a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

## What is SHA-256 / SHA-512?

SHA-256 and SHA-512 are cryptographic hash functions from the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family, developed by the NSA and published by NIST.

They are widely used in security applications like:

- Password hashing
- Digital signatures
- Blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin uses SHA-256)
- File integrity verification

## What Does a Hash Function Do?

A hash function takes an input (any size) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. It:

- Cannot be reversed (one-way function)
- Is deterministic (same input â†’ same output)
- Is collision-resistant (different inputs produce different outputs)
