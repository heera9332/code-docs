# RSA Algorithm – Public Key Cryptography

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, which means it uses a pair of keys:

- Public Key for encryption
- Private Key for decryption

It is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

## Steps in the RSA Algorithm

1. Key Generation
2. Public and Private Keys
3. Encryption
4. Decryption

## RSA Applications

- Secure web traffic (HTTPS)
- Digital signatures
- Email encryption (PGP)
- Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
