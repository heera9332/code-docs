# AutHentication & Authorization

Authentication and authorization are critical components of any secure website, web application, or mobile app. They work together to ensure that users are properly identified and only allowed to access resources they're permitted to.

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user through credentials like a username/password or social login.
- **Authorization** determines what resources or actions an authenticated user is allowed to access. A user may be authenticated but not authorized to perform certain actions.

## 🔐 Authentication

Authentication methods commonly used in Node.js applications include:

- **Username and password** login
- **OAuth-based social logins** (e.g., Google, GitHub, Facebook) using libraries like `passport.js` or Firebase Auth
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for enhanced security
- **Token-based authentication** using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Example authentication stack in Node.js:
- Express.js
- Passport.js
- bcrypt (for password hashing)
- JWT or session-based authentication

## 🛡️ Authorization

Authorization involves checking user permissions and access levels. This typically includes:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – e.g., roles like `admin`, `user`, `editor`
- **Permission-Based Access Control** – e.g., `canEdit`, `canDelete`, `canViewReports`
- **Middleware logic in Node.js** to protect routes and APIs
- **JWT Claims** to carry access levels inside tokens

Example flow:
1. Authenticate the user via login
2. Generate a JWT token with role/permissions
3. On each request, verify the token and enforce access based on roles

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always hash passwords securely (e.g., using `bcrypt`)
- Use HTTPS for all authentication and token exchanges
- Store sensitive tokens securely (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies or secure storage)
- Regularly audit roles and permissions
- Implement logging and monitoring for authentication and access attempts

Secure authentication and robust authorization are the foundation of a safe and scalable backend system. Implement both carefully to protect your application and user data.

## 🧑‍💼 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a security mechanism that restricts system access based on user roles. Each user is assigned one or more roles, and each role is granted specific permissions to perform actions or access resources.

### 🔑 Key Concepts

- **User**: The individual using the application
- **Role**: A named collection of permissions (e.g., `admin`, `editor`, `user`)
- **Permission**: The access rights assigned to roles (e.g., `can_edit_post`, `can_view_dashboard`)

### 🛠️ How RBAC Works in Node.js

RBAC can be implemented in a Node.js backend (e.g., using Express) with:

- A `role` field stored in the user's record (e.g., in MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
- Middleware that checks the user’s role before granting access to routes

### 🚀 Example Middleware

```js
// middleware/authorizeRole.js
function authorizeRole(requiredRoles = []) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const userRole = req.user?.role;

    if (!requiredRoles.includes(userRole)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
    }

    next();
  };
}
module.exports = authorizeRole;
```
