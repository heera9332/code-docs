# WordPress Trouble Tricks

If you’re new to WordPress, it’s perfectly normal to encounter errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior while developing your website. WordPress is a powerful platform that can help you build sites quickly, but its compatibility with various themes, plugins, and PHP versions can sometimes lead to confusion.

In this guide, we’ll cover common issues you might face—ranging from PHP warnings to Elementor errors, theme-related hiccups, WooCommerce setup quirks, and debugging methods. We’ll also point you to official resources and refer to our previous blog posts for deeper insights and additional troubleshooting strategies.

*(For more in-depth tutorials and related resources, refer to our previous blog posts: [My Previous WordPress Articles](#) and also check the official WordPress documentation.)*

## Common WordPress Warnings and PHP Errors

### Why They Happen

You might see warnings or errors if:

- Your theme or plugins are using outdated PHP functions.
- The WordPress-recommended PHP version doesn’t match the one running on your server.
- You’ve installed a new theme or plugin that requires a higher or different PHP version.

**Tips:**

- **Check PHP Version:** Confirm your server meets the [WordPress Recommended Requirements](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).  
- **Update Themes and Plugins:** Keep themes and plugins updated to maintain compatibility with the latest WordPress and PHP versions.

## Troubleshooting Elementor Issues

[Elementor](https://elementor.com/help/) is a popular page builder, but sometimes you might face:

1. **Templates Not Importing:** This could be due to server limitations, plugin conflicts, or memory constraints.
2. **Stuck at the Loading Screen:** Try deactivating plugins one by one to identify conflicts, increase PHP memory limits, or switch to a default WordPress theme temporarily.
3. **Internal Server Errors:** Check your server error logs and consider enabling WordPress debugging (see below). most of this error occurs due memory limitation. elementor has not enough to do things.
4. **Header/Footer Not Showing:** Ensure display conditions are set correctly and verify you’re using a compatible theme or [Elementor’s official Header & Footer builder](https://elementor.com/help/).

## Theme-Specific Errors

Different themes have their own quirks. Popular free themes like [OceanWP](https://docs.oceanwp.org/), [Astra](https://wpastra.com/docs/), and [Hello Elementor](https://elementor.com/help/hello-theme/) are well-documented, but issues can still arise.

### Common Issues in OceanWP

- **Title Display on Every Page:** Adjust settings under “Appearance > Customize” to hide or modify page titles.
- **Borders Around Header Items:** Remove or adjust borders using the theme’s customization options or add custom CSS.
- **Full-Width Pages Not Working:** Choose a full-width template in the page attributes or theme customization panel.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [OceanWP Documentation](https://docs.oceanwp.org/) and our [previous blog posts](#) for theme customization tips.

## Theme/Plugin Development Issues

If you’re developing your own theme or plugin, you might face challenges like:

1. **Logs Not Showing:** Enable [WordPress Debugging](https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/) to see errors in the `wp-content/debug.log`.
2. **JavaScript Not Working:** Check the browser console for errors and ensure scripts are enqueued correctly using `wp_enqueue_script`.
3. **CSS Not Working:** Make sure styles are enqueued properly with `wp_enqueue_style`, clear your cache, and confirm the stylesheet is linked.
4. **Additional CSS Not Working in Customizer:** Ensure you’ve saved changes properly and that the theme doesn’t override these settings.

## WooCommerce Issues

[WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/documentation/) is a versatile e-commerce plugin, but it’s not without its quirks:

- **Missing WooCommerce Pages After Installation:**  
  WooCommerce usually creates pages like Shop, Cart, and Checkout automatically. If not, go to `WooCommerce > Status > Tools` and click “Create default WooCommerce pages.” If that fails, create pages manually and assign them under `WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced`.

- **Cart Not Working or Missing:**  
  Manually create a Cart page if needed, and assign it as the Cart page in `WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced`.

- **Custom Pages Not Displaying Properly:**  
  Ensure the right pages are linked in `WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced`, or try building pages with the Gutenberg editor or Elementor Pro.

## Bonus Tips: Enabling WordPress Debugging

When troubleshooting complex issues, enabling debugging can provide valuable insights.

**How to Enable Debugging:**

1. **Edit `wp-config.php`:**  
   Add these lines or update existing ones:
   ```php
   define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
   define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
   define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
   @ini_set( 'display_errors', 0 );
