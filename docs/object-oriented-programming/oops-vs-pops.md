# OOPs vs POPs

OOPs and POPs both are the type of programming paradism, used in the development, both have its own advantages and disadvantages.

## OOPs

`Full Form - Object-Oriented Programming System`

It is a type programming, which is purely based on Classes and Objects.

- Good for scalable and maintable
- Complex and require depth knowledge
- 

## POPs

`Full Form - Produral-Oriented Programming System`

Procedural-Oriented Programming system. based on functions and procedures.

## OOPs vs POPs

| OOP                                                              | POP                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| OOP stands for Object-oriented programming.                      | POP stands for procedural oriented programming.      |
| Program is divided into parts called objects.                    | Program is divided into small parts called function. |
| It follows bottom-up approach.                                   | It follows top-down approach.                        |
| It has access specifiers names as public, protected and private. | It has no access specifier.                          |
| It is secure than POP.                                           | It is lesser secure than OOP.                        |
| Overloading is possible in the form of function overloading and operator overloading. | Overloading is not possible | Example of Object-Oriented Programming languages are: C++, Java, Python, VB.NET, C#.NET, JavaScript | Example of Procedure Oriented Programming languages are: C, FORTRAN, Pascal.|
