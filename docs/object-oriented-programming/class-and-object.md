# Class & Object

Class is a blueprint of an object, which define the functionality and attributes of an object.

- Class is only the structure of an object.
- Class is a user-defined data type.
- `class` is used to create a class

```cpp
class Student {
  string name;
  int age;
};

int main() {
  // new user-defined data type, so let's create a variable of that type
  Student student;
  cout << student.name << endl;
}
```

## Types of Classes

### Abstract Class

Any class with one abstract method is called an abstract class. When we take an abstract method in a class then we need to declare a class with 
abstract keyword.
