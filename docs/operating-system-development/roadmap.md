# 🧠 Roadmap to Build Your Own Operating System (OS)

Creating your own OS is a challenging but highly rewarding project. This guide is designed to take you from zero to a basic functional OS step-by-step.

---

## 🧭 Overview of OS Development Phases

---

### 🟢 Phase 1: Preparation & Fundamentals

**🎯 Goal:** Understand how an OS works and set up your environment.

- Learn **C** (deep dive) and **Assembly** (x86 basics).
- Understand boot process: **BIOS → Bootloader → Kernel**.
- Learn basic computer architecture (x86/x86_64 or ARM).

**Resources:**

- 📘 [The Little Book About OS Development](https://littleosbook.github.io/)
- 📗 “Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces” (OSTEP Book)

---

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Setup Environment

**🎯 Goal:** Prepare your development and testing environment.

- Install essential tools:
  - `GCC` or `Clang`
  - `NASM` or `GAS`
  - `QEMU` or `Bochs`
  - `GRUB` bootloader

**Project Structure:**

```bash
/myos/
├── bootloader/
├── kernel/
└── Makefile

```

## 🔁 Phase 3: Bootloader

- 🎯 Goal: Create a bootloader to load your kernel.
- Write 16-bit real mode boot sector in Assembly.
- Transition to protected mode or use GRUB to load the kernel.

```bash title="boot.asm"
[bits 16]
org 0x7c00

jmp start
start:
  mov ah, 0x0E
  mov al, 'H'
  int 0x10
  jmp $

times 510 - ($ - $$) db 0
dw 0xAA55

```

## 🧠 Phase 4: Kernel Development (C + ASM)

🎯 Goal: Write a simple kernel with a C entry point.

- Switch to Protected Mode
- Setup GDT (Global Descriptor Table)
- Setup IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)
- Handle keyboard & timer interrupts
- Add a kernel_main() function

```c
void kernel_main() {
  printf("Welcome to MyOS!");
  while(1);
}
```

## 🧩 Phase 5: Core Kernel Features

🎯 Goal: Implement key OS functionalities.

- ✅ Memory Management (Physical/Virtual, Paging, Heap)
- ✅ FileSystem Support (FAT32, EXT2)
- ✅ Drivers (Keyboard, Display, Disk)
- ✅ Interrupts & System Calls
- ✅ Process Scheduler & Multitasking
- ✅ Basic Shell or TUI (optional)

## 🧑‍💻 Phase 6: User Space & Applications

🎯 Goal: Create a basic CLI with user programs.

- Setup system call interface
- Implement ELF binary loader
- Create shell, calculator, etc.

## 🚀 Phase 7: Advanced Features (Optional)

🎯 Goal: Take your OS to the next level.

- Build Networking Stack (TCP/IP)
- Create GUI with VESA/Framebuffer
- Add USB, PCIe drivers
- Multi-core CPU support

## 📁 Example Project Folder Structure

```bash
/myos

│   └── boot.asm
├── kernel/
│   ├── kernel.c
│   ├── memory.c
│   └── scheduler.c
├── drivers/
│   ├── keyboard.c
│   └── video.c
├── include/
│   └── kernel.h
├── lib/
│   └── stdio.c
└── Makefile

```
