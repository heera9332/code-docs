# Introduction to AI & ML

A broad field that aims to make machines smart â€” able to mimic human behavior like thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, etc.

It includes:

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- And more

## Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of AI that focuses on giving machines the ability to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

For example:

- You give a model a dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
- It learns patterns and can start detecting spam in new emails.
