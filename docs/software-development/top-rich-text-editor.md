- Tiptap is most powerful/extensible, but some advanced features require a commercial license.
- BlockNote is free, beautiful, easy, and uses Tiptap under the hood.
- CKEditor 5 if you need a very mature, enterprise, feature-rich editor (some - features paid).
- Slate/Payload if you want to build very custom UIs or use with Payload CMS.
- Lexical is new and very fast if you want a future-proof, performant, and modern - block editor.
